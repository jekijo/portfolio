### About Me
I am a Data Scientist graduate with an educational background in psychology and neuroscience. In addition to my two degrees I have 
multiple projects showcasing the skills I've acquired, as well as new projects that I continue to work on. You can read more about
my projects and experiences here! Along with descriptions, I've also included any report papers that were written proceeding 
the completion of team based projects.

### Experience 
#### Hack for LA 
After graduating from undergrad, I spent a year gaining additional software engineering skills to build on a few classes I had taken. I then joined a group of volunteer engineers and data scientists to help on the 311 Data project, where I
contributed as a full stack engineer to help implement new features to the 311 Data website for roughly 6 months. More information about this org can be found [here](https://www.hackforla.org/projects/311-data).<br />

### Projects
#### Neural Decoding of Movement (Ongoing)
Using an open source neurophysiology dataset that contains spike activity from neural population recordings, I trained a vanilla pytorch neural network to predict movements from the neural data. The original neural network expressed
unsatisfactory performance, running into the vanishing gradient problem. The next step for this project will be to implement an LSTM to attempt to boost performance. There is currently no Github link for this project, but I will be updating the
progress on this project frequently! Here is a [link](https://elifesciences.org/articles/73155#s4) to the paper that this project’s data was collected from. 

#### Steam Review Sentiment Analysis
- Worked with a team to use supervised & unsupervised learning methods to analyze and predict Steam game reviews’ sentiment.
- Used supervised methods (logistic regression, random forest, SVM, multinomial naive Bayes) to predict whether a review was positive or negative.
- Used unsupervised methods (LSA andLDA) to extract the language features most predictive of review sentiment.
- The findings from this project can be viewed in the [final report](assets/Steam_Final_Report.pdf).

#### College Football Player Transfer Predictions
##### [Full Report](assets/CFB_Report.pdf) 
Using all open source data found from multiple sources, our team of three created a website that utilized supervised learning models to predict the probability that any given college football player would enter the transfer portal. We combined various player statistics, team statistics, coaching, and recruiting information into one large dataset. Due to class imbalances, we used SMOTE to oversample the minority class to improve model performance.<br />
From here, multiple different models were trained on various iterations of the data to cover offensive positions as well as defense. Below you can see the tables detailing evaluation results for each model compared to a dummy classifier, as well as the average probability returned for the positive and negative class for each model.

#### NBA Draft Pick Success Analysis
##### [Full Report](assets/NBA_Report.pdf)
Worked with two other students to analyze how the draft ranking of an NBA player relates to both individual and team success. We cleaned and combined multiple data sources ranging over the past few decades covering player statistics, player accolades, team statistics and accolades, and player draft data. From here, we created multiple visualizations to showcase different relationships between draft position and different metrics of success.<br />
You can find a more detailed slide deck of our findings, as well as all of our visualizations in the full report link. We also go over additional background information, motivations, and how we defined success within our project.
